# Code Injector

The Code Injector is a tool designed for injecting custom code into target applications or systems to perform various tasks, such as code execution, data manipulation, or privilege escalation.

## Introduction

Code injection is a technique used to insert malicious code into a target process, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands or perform unauthorized actions. The Code Injector tool simplifies this process by providing a user-friendly interface for injecting custom code into target applications.

## Features

- **Dynamic Code Injection:** Inject custom code into target processes in real-time.
- **Multiple Injection Techniques:** Support for various code injection techniques, such as DLL injection, shellcode injection, or process hollowing.
- **Payload Generation:** Generate payloads containing custom code to be injected into target processes.
- **Remote Code Execution:** Execute code remotely on target systems by injecting it into running processes.
- **Stealth Mode:** Hide the presence of the injected code to evade detection by security tools.

## Usage

1. **Target Selection:** Specify the target process or application into which the code will be injected.
2. **Code Configuration:** Write or generate the custom code to be injected into the target.
3. **Injection Method:** Choose the appropriate injection technique based on the target environment and desired outcome.
4. **Initiate Injection:** Start the injection process and monitor the execution of the injected code.
5. **Verify Results:** Confirm that the injected code has executed as intended and achieved the desired outcome.

## Warning

Code injection is a powerful and potentially dangerous technique that can lead to system instability or compromise if used improperly. This tool should only be used for legitimate purposes and with appropriate authorization.
